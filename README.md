# FaceIt
__updated: 07/07/2021__

## Introduction

This project is a continuation of an application originally built for Turing School of Software & Design. [See original version here](https://github.com/gaj23/face-it)

A customized [API](https://github.com/conconartist/faceit-sql-server) was implemented for this project to categorize makeup products by "Cruelty Free", "Fair Trade", "Organic", "Vegan", and "Zero-Waste." This expands upon the limitations of the previously used [Makeup API](https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/) to include more categories and simplification within these categories to focus on sustainable and environmentally-friendly options for the user.
